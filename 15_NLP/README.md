Intro to Data Science Class15: 
=======

## Natural Language Processing

- Announcements/Questions: 
- History of NLP
- State of the art in NLP
- Common NLP tasks
- Topic Modeling
- Lab: Practice 

## Objectives

* Have a sense for what problems NLP methods are capable of solving currently
* Understand common methods for treating texts in NLP problem solving: Vectorizing, TF-IDF
* Understand how to compute document similarity
* Know concepts related to Topic Modeling

## Homework:

- Continue working on your project

## Class Materials
