# Hadoop, Hive, & Pig Lab

For this lab we will use the [HortonWorks Sandbox](http://hortonworks.com/sandbox/) which has many tools available from the hadoop ecosystem.

To do the exercises, you need to have the sandbox installed on your local machine.

1. Start up the virtual machine (note, your vagrant machine should **not** be running for this exercise. run `vagrant halt` to stop that machine from running)

2. Open the "HUE" in your browser by navigating to the following address: `127.0.0.1:8000`

3. SSH into the machine from a terminal by executing the following command: `ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222`


There are a number of [tutorials](http://hortonworks.com/tutorials/) on the HortonWorks site. We will focus on three for today:

- [Hello World! â€“ An introduction to Hadoop with Hive and Pig](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/hello-world-an-introduction-to-hadoop-hcatalog-hive-and-pig/)

-  [How to Process Data with Apache Hive](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/how-to-process-data-with-apache-hive/)
